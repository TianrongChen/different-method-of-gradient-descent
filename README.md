Implement of gradient descent, Newton Method and SGD
Important!!!!


Copyright stuff:
This code comes from Georgia Tech ECE 6254. The base code is given by professor Bloch;

My work:
Implement Newton method, with two method. Please refer to the function cal_Hessian_1 and cal_Hessian in the code. The first one cannot be used for extremely large data set because of the large diagonal Matrix.
Implement SGD.
